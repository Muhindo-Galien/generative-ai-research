Countries are sorted by nominal GDP estimates from financial and statistical institutions, which are calculated at market or government official exchange rates. Nominal GDP does not take into account differences in the cost of living in different countries, and the results can vary greatly from one year to another based on fluctuations in the exchange rates of the country's currency. Such fluctuations may change a country's ranking from one year to the next, even though they often make little or no difference in the standard of living of its population.\n",

Other metrics, nominal GDP per capita and a corresponding GDP (PPP) per capita, are used for comparing national standard of living. On the whole, PPP per capita figures are less spread than nominal GDP per capita figures.\n",
      "The rankings of national economies have changed significantly over time. For instance, the United States overtook the British Empire around 1916; Japan rose rapidly in the post-World War II period to become the world’s second-largest economy by the 1970s; China moved from ninth place in 1978 to second in 2010 following market reforms; and more recently India has climbed into the top five. These shifts reflect long-term changes in global economic output.\n",

The opposition Labour Party, led by Keir Starmer, won a landslide victory over the governing Conservative Party under Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, ending 14 years of Conservative government.\n",
      "Labour secured 411 seats and a 174-seat majority, the third-best showing in the party's history and its best since 2001. The party's vote share was 33.7%, the lowest of any majority party on record, making this the least proportional general election in British history. They became the largest party in England, Scotland and Wales. The Conservatives suffered their worst-ever defeat, winning 121 seats with 23.7% of the vote and losing 251 seats, including those of the former prime minister Liz Truss and 12 Cabinet ministers.\n",
      "Smaller parties saw record support, with 42.6% of the total vote. The Liberal Democrats, led by Ed Davey, became the third-largest party with 72 seats, their best modern result. Reform UK, led by Nigel Farage, won five seats and 14.3% of the vote, the third-highest vote share, and the Green Party won four seats. For both parties this was their best parliamentary result to date.\n",
      "In Scotland the Scottish National Party dropped from 48 to 9 seats, losing its status as Scotland's largest party. In Wales, Plaid Cymru won four seats. In Northern Ireland, which has a distinct set of political parties, Sinn Féin retained seven seats; the first election in which an Irish nationalist party won the most seats in Northern Ireland. The Democratic Unionist Party dropped from 8 to 5 seats.\n",
      "Campaign issues included the economy, healthcare, housing, energy and immigration. There was relatively little discussion of Brexit, which was a major issue during the 2019 general election. This was the first general election under the Dissolution and Calling of Parliament Act 2022, the first with photo identification required to vote in Great Britain, and the first fought using the new constituency boundaries implemented following the 2023 review of Westminster constituencies.\n",

It also controls twelve local councils. It sits on the right-wing of the left–right political spectrum, generally to the right of the Conservative Party. Nigel Farage has been Leader of Reform UK since June 2024.\n",
      "Co-founded by Farage and Catherine Blaiklock in 2018 as the Brexit Party, advocating a no-deal Brexit, it won the most seats at the 2019 European Parliament election in the UK, but won no seats at the 2019 general election. The UK withdrew from the European Union in January 2020, and later in the same year the COVID-19 pandemic began in the UK. The Conservative government imposed a series of national lockdowns and Farage focused on anti-lockdown campaigning. The party was renamed Reform UK in January 2021. Farage stepped down as leader in March 2021 and was succeeded by Richard Tice.\n",

In June 2024 Farage resumed the leadership, and the party won five seats at the 2024 general election, the first time it had elected MPs.\n",

This \\nmeans that if the market hits your stop loss you will lose 50 pips which \\nis 50$, and if the market hit the profit target, you will win 100$. \\nThe size of your position depends on whether you have a standard or \\na mini account, and how many lots you are trading. This information is \\nimportant to you because this will help you know how much money \\nyou risk on each trade. \\nThe risk to reward ratio \\nThe risk to reward ratio concept is what will make you a winner in the \\nlong run. Before you enter any trade, you have to know how much \\nmoney you will win if the market goes in your favor, and how much \\nmoney you will lose if the market goes against you. \\nDon’t never enter a trade in which the profit is less than the amount \\nof money you risked.  \\nIf you will risk 100$ for example, your profit target s hould be at least \\n200$, this is a risk to reward ratio of 1:2. \\nLet’s suppose that you took 10 trades with 1:2 risks to reward ratio. In \\nevery trade you risk 100$. \\nYou won 5trades, and you lost 5 trades. So you will lose 500$.but you \\nwill win 1000$.so the benefits is 500$. \\nThis is the power of the risk to reward ratio, you shouldn’t think that \\nyou have to win all your trades to become a successful trader.
